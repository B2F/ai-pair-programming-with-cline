# Respect privacy / confidentiality

**Crucially important**

Never request to read files containing **private keys** (API, passwords) and **private data**, such as env.local, local.settings, etc.

**Let the user manage private data without AI intervention**: do not authenticate on databases yourself, ask user to run the code and to provide you with the results.
